# aedesData

Found on all continents, and transported to the southern Unites States through global trade and shipping, the Aedes mosquito---carrying yellow and dengue fever, the Zika virus, and Chikungunya---infects nearly 100 million people world wide, causing millions of deaths every year.
The CDC, in an effort to prevent US infections, disease burden, and deaths, has issued an open challeneg to predict Aedes incidence in the US.
Accurate prediction of Aedes can significantly reduce disease burden, warning public health officals of a potential epidemic before it is too late.
